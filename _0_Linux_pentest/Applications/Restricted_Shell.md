# Restricted shells
## rbash 
### gain a shell 
 - Can you change $PATH and $SHELL? try to launch a real shell using this
 - What are the binaries you can use?
	- type TAB, then A+TAB, B+TAB, etc.
	- type sudo -l to see if you can execute these binaries as another user. Try to find a GTFOBin amongst these in order to get a real shell with these user rights

### gain access to folders and files
if you cannot use the forward slash due to the restricted shell, but  aim for a specific file, you can use tricks such as mapfile MYFILE < ..${HOME:0:1}.passwd (where ${HOME:0:1} will be used as the slash)

### practical examples
See example of both techniques in [ch14 - Bash - shells restreints](:/fa152db6c20644469794ac870a3d9315)
