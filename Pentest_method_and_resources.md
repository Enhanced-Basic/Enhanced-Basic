# Table of contents
This is a set of documents and resources intended to help an evaluator in the course of performing a vulnerability analysis in the context of a CC/AVA_VAN3+, FitCEM/High or BSZ/CSPN evaluation. The evaluator should select the appropriate sections depending on the TOE type and technology:

- [Linux system pentesting](_0_Linux_pentest/0_Linux_system_pentesting.md) is a method for pentesting applciative TOEs that run on Linux or full systems based on a Linux OS: The method notabley includes general methods:
     - For [Linux privilege escalation](_0_Linux_pentest/1_Annex_Linux_privesc.md) including hints for shells/restricted shells/Busybox exploitation, process injection...
     - For [Network privilege escalation](_0_Linux_pentest/2_Annex_Network_privesc.md), including hints on scans, packet modification or crafting...
     - For [Applicative privilege escalation](_0_Linux_pentest/3_Annex_Applicative_privesc.md), including hints for configuration, design and implementation review, with additional details for some applications (SSH, web applications...)
- [Windows system pentesting](...) [not yet planned] 
- ... 

The following supporting methods are also provided:
 - Code review methods:
     - [C code review](_0_Linux_pentest\Code_review\C_code_review_VAN3.md)
     - Python code review [planned but not started yet] 
 - [Public vulnerability analysis](_1_Public_vulnerability_analysis/Public_vulnerability_analysis_101.md)[planned but not started yet]
 - [Crypto analysis](_2_Crypto/Crypto101.md)[planned but not started yet]

Additional resources are provided as an ongoing project, they are mostly a byproduct of self training and can be used by others for the same purpose ([writeups and material related to challenges / CTFs](_3_Challenges_and_CTFs))


# Some context and main principles

AVA_VAN.3+ testing shares some common points with pentesting - however it also differs from it on several key points:
 - The evaluator is in a **white box** situation, and will often have a **privileged account** on the TOE to be tested. This is partly true even in a BSZ/CSPN evaluation: even if source code is not available, a privileged access to the TOE is provided.
 - Not only this, but the evaluator is in a **chosen white box**, in the sense that they can ask clarification/edits to the documentation as they see fit (within the limits of the CC requirements)
 - The analysis relies on the scoring of attacks on an attack potential scale, which means that the evaluator **does not have to actually perform attacks** whenever a vulnerability is scored as low enough.   

The main issues for the evaluator are
 - not asking enough good questions on the documentation makes you act as in a blackbox situation and lose time. YOu _must_ participate in the ADV review!
 - As in pentesting, if you act without a clear goal, you will probably not find anything in a constraint time frame. Apply "hack tricks" in various directions, without even being sure that they are actually relevant for the TOE security problem definition, will lead to nothing.
 - As you have many paths to assess a vulnerability, you need to use the fastest one. Some tools of the trade are also useless (e.g direct password attack is useless because you have a direct access to the passwors policy. Here you should simply give an expert opinion on the policy itself)



Therefore, the evaluator always needs to ask themselves at each step:
 - What am I trying to achieve? (i.e. what are my objectives and _attack scenarios_?) 
 - What are the resources I can use? (i.e. what are the available _attack vectors_)
 - What can I use to exploit these resources? (_method and tools_)

This method mainly aims at providing a **limited set of choices for the each question**, so that the evaluator does not get lost during their assessment.
