## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on security evaluation of software products, in the context of Common Criteria certifications and other similar frameworks
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning vulnerability analysis / software pentesting
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m trying to build a general-purpose method that could be used in AVA_VAN.3 evaluations. Any collab is welcome!  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m particularly looking for feedback on Linux/network content, which will be my main focus point at the moment. If anyone wants to add Windows or mobile content, I'd be happy to merge it in
