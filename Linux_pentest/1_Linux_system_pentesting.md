# Describe the main attack scenarios

The evaluator _shall_ first read all SFRs/SF in the ST and define a table of scenarios to detail the following attacker main objectives:

* _Compromising the security_ of the TOE (the TOE is targeted for its own assets), or
* _Compromising the trustworthiness_ of the TOE, a.k.a. _pivoting_ (the TOE is used is a springboard to compromise the security of _another product or system_ that uses/trusts it).

The evaluator _should_ use the following template as a basis, and add any other relevant scenario depending on the ST (other primary security functions of the TOE, _deeper_ support functions such as system hardening, secure boot, physical protection...)

## Template for scenario description

| Security Function                                                                                                                                     | Scenario to compromise the security of the TOE                                                                                                                                                                                               | Scenario to compromise the trustworthiness of the TOE                                                                      |

| **Level 3 - Audit and accountability**                                                                                                                | **Tamper/craft TOE outputs**, typically compromise audit logs in order to facilitate or mask Level 2 scenarios                                                                                                                   | **Tamper/craft TOE outputs**, typically compromise audit logs in order to facilitate or mask Level 2 scenarios |

**Notes**

* The template is _levelled_ because SFs are not all born equal: some are meant to protect primary assets, and many others are merely there to support these primary SFs.
* The template defines 3 main _scenarios_ (Bypass flow control, Tamper/craft TOE outputs, Elevate privileges) - they correspond to groups of SFs that are often found in most types of TOEs. They obviously need to be completed/adapted for each TOE.

## Attack vectors

The security target defines several attack vectors as part of its threats and assumptions definition. The evaluator could be tempted to limit its analysis from these vectors (e.g. some groups of users may be trusted by assumption). However, privilege escalation plays a large part in the method: the evaluator may therefore "unlock" attack vectors during the evaluation, as they progress in their analysis: even if a vector is assumed trusted by the ST, it will have to be studied if an attacker can obtain access to this vector.

For this reason, it is recommended that the privilege escalation is tested prior to any other scenario: the other scenarios can then be tested from all attack vectors, including those unlocked by privilege escalation.

# Follow the available methods for each scenario

## Elevate privileges

Methods are available for the following initial attack vectors:

* [Anonymous network access](Privilege_escalation/0_From_anonymous_network_access.md), including network-reachable or offline third-party services;
* [Applicative user session](Privilege_escalation/1_From_user_applicative_session.md);
* [Non-privileged code or command execution](Privilege_escalation/2_From_User_code_or_cmd_exec.md);
* [Non-privileged shell](Privilege_escalation/3_From_user_shell.md).

Notes:

* Two additional vectors are listed here for the sake of completeness, but are (at least in most cases) out of scope of CC evaluations:
  * [Root Shell](Privilege_escalation/4_From_root_shell.md)
  * [Kernel code execution](Privilege_escalation/5_From_Kernel_code_execution.md)
* This method assumes that the evaluator will exhaustively test all attack vectors. If exhaustiveness is not required, the evaluator will need to carefully chose whether to start with more privileged attack vectors (attack has potentially more impact) or less privileged (attack is potentially more accessible). It would make sense for an AVA_VAN.3 evaluation to address in priority the less privileged and most accessible attack vectors, but this method does not recommend any particular path.

## Bypass flow control

The typical example of flow control as a primary security function is a firewall function. The actual flow control functionality will depend on the TOE. In this example, _bypassing control flow_ means _evading the FW rules_. Similar types of attacks can concern:

* Diodes: bypassing the unidirectionnality, or the content inspection...
* VPN: bypassing the tunnel protection, or the kill switch (e.g. allowing cleartext to flow after a tunnel failure),
* Network switches: bypassing the VLAN segregation
* etc.

All methods related to this topic can be found in the section _Evasion_ of [Additional network methods](2_Additional_network_methods.md)

## Tamper/craft TOE outputs

The scenario consists in either

* crafting outputs to support another attack (e.g. erasing error messages from a log)
* crafting an input so that the TOE creates a malicious output (e.g. log poisoning). A weaker version consists in using the TOE to tunnel malicious content (e.g. port forwarding to another target).

These attack methods are described in the section _Pivot_ of [Additional network methods](2_Additional_network_methods.md).
