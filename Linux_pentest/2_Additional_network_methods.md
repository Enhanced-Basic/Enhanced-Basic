# Evasion (VPN/FW/IDS/gateway/diodes...)
## VPN and secure channels
Regardless of potential privilege escalation, a protocol may provide security properties (integrity, confidentiality, anti-replay...). As a part of a general *Information flow bypass*, the evaluator should try to check whether the protocol itself can be bypassed
 - [TODO] secure channel
 - [TODO] kill switch / firewall part of the secure channel
## FW evasion
 - [TODO] add external resources on FW evasion and discuss - testing FW evasion is tricky, since it is dependent on context, rules expressiveness and usability, etc. For the moment, this aspect is not addressed in this method and is considered more a functional test of the FW capacity than a security topic. The same rules holds for gateway that allow or block traffic based on protocol analyses.
## Diodes and TAPs
 - [TODO] attacks on directionality / protocol translation
 - [TODO] out of scope: HW attacks on optical diodes
## VLAN evasion
 - [TODO] 


# Pivoting - pass or craft malicious data through the TOE
## log tampering
 - [TODO] erase messages / inject content in the logs
## Tunnel/forward malicious content through the TOE
 - [TODO] see notably SSH forwarding etc
## Emit malicious content through the TOE 
this case is a bit different, since it supposes that the attacker can use the TOE itself to transform input data in malicious data for other systems connected to the TOE. It requires 
 - either that the attacker exploits TOE input transformation rules,  
 - or that the attacker elevates their privileges on the TOE to craft arbitrary malicious data. In real life scenarios,
 - a preauth SSRF can for example be used by an attacker to make a network scan from the TOE and discover its next targets
 - logs could be poisoned so as to include malicious content for the software that will read them
 - etc

[TODO]: add:
 - practical test steps for pentesting the capacity to recompose malicious data through gateways, diodes...
