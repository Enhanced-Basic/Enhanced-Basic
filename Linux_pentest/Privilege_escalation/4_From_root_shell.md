This attack vector is relevant for:
 - exploiting further a root access to reach a given asset. Example: "we have root but are not able to read cleartext credentials that are exchanged in an SSH session because everything is done in memory"
 - post exploitation techniques (persistence, deletion of traces, and so on)


The former may have sense in some very specific cases of evaluations, but as a general rule, root is trusted, and root privilege escalation should in itself cause a failure of the AVA_VAN component. For this reason, we will not detail further the attack scenarios until a real life evaluation makes us look into these exploitation techniques. 
The latter is, as a general rule, out of scope of CC evalautions, and is therefore not explored further for the moment.
