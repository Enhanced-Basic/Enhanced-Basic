# Evaluation of available documentation

## General approach

In a CC evaluation, for each main security function, the evaluator will&#x20;

* first, try to determine whether the ADV documentation is sufficiently clear, and
* then, check that the TOE conforms to this description (preferably during the ADV review if the TOE is already available, but it can be performed later).

As a rule of thumb, by the end of the documentation review, the evaluator should be able to select a given asset (e.g. a user PERSONAL_DATA, transmitted to the TOE over the network) and check whether they can easily:

* Identify the TSFI by which PERSONAL_DATA arrives on the TOE (ADV_FSP);
* Identify which process/daemon/service holds DATA in memory? which files/sockets hold PERSONAL_DATA? which users can access it? (ADV_TDS):
  * additionally: are these components proprietary or pure upstream open source, and in which versions? (ALC_CMS);
* Identify which process/daemon/service control the information flow allowing PERSONAL_DATA to pass (ADV_ARC)?
* etc.

## _Upstream_ vs _Non-upstream_

Throughout this part, the notion of "upstream" is heavily used. While the definition is not fixed, it mainly distinguishes between:

* **Upstream**: pure unmodified components from a third-party (_well-recognized_ open source or COTS);
* **Non-upstream**: primarily components patched or developed by the TOE developer. It is also recommended to consider as _non-upstream_ any component from a _lesser-recognized_ open source or COTS.

The reason of this classification is to focus the AVA analysis on non-upstream parts, and skipping it, at least partly, for upstream parts:

* we do not expect to be able to find vulnerabilities in the design or the implementation of the linux kernel or the OpenSSL library during the evaluation. For these parts, it makes more sense to focus on configuration and CVEs;&#x20;
* we might find vulnerabilities in lesser-known or obscure open source libraries, or in proprietary parts. We will therefore analyze the design, implementation as well as the configuration and CVEs.

A similar logic applies to crypto or network protocols - it does not make sense to challenge the design of a _recognized_ protocol (known RFCs or ISO standard, algorithms recognized by the certification scheme, etc.), and therefore it makes more sense to concentrate on its configuration and implementation. Quite the contrary, for proprietary protocols, vulnerabilities are possible in configuration, implementation _and_ design.

## ALC_CMS

### CC refinements for a linux-based TOE

As a general rule, ALC_CMS requires to identify the various _static parts_ of the TOE. The main question here is the granularity of parts:

* _Non-upstream parts_ should be listed at the level of the source code file&#x20;
* _Upstream parts_ may be described with a larger granularity (e.g. a closed-source, COTS .so library, or an open-source RPM package can both be a single configuration item).

### Expected ALC_CMS content

In order to meet the ALC_CMS.3.1C to ALC_CMS.3.3C requirements, the following tables are expected:

| Item ID | Type                                                              | Version | Developer (if TSF-relevant)                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ...  | For **non-upstream** parts: source code file, configuration file, makefile, test data file...<br>For **upstream** parts: library, package, binary... | ...     | (e.g. if subcontractors provide parts of the source code) |

Additional guidance:
* Identification is up to the developer to decide, but as a rule of thumb, the list should allow to identify the ID and versions of any upstream component (kernel, distro, programs, libs...), as well as the initial ID and version of any *patched* upstream component. Typically, the ID can be built by using [ID and versions from the initial open source component]-[ID of the proprietary patch]
* in order to fully meet AMLC_CMS.3 requirements, the developer must also provide identification of the TOE itself (e.g. by giving a release version), and identification/versioning of the evaluation evidence. With modern configuration management systems, it may make sense to store documentation alongside source code. The configuration list would be, in this case, a chicken-and-egg problem. 
 * while it is not required explicitly by CC, it would be good practice to add hashes to the configuration list generated by the configuration management tool. It also eases the work to meet ALC_DEL requirements.

## ADV_TDS

### CC refinements for a linux-based TOE

As a general rule, on a linux-based TOE:

* _Modules_ are typically **processes, daemons or services** executing on the TOE.
* _Interactions between modules_ are typically:
  * The initialization parameters of the module:
    * configuration files or environment variables used by the module
    * variables/flags used when starting the module
    * privileges of the module (kernel/root/user)
  * User interface: CLI, GUI... (typically relevant for processes)
  * IPCs: signals, sockets/dbus, pipes, message queues, semaphores, shared files, shared memory...
  * network communication: network sockets
* a _Subsystem_ can be anything from a process/daemon/service to a whole linux Kernel. The amount and hierarchy of subsystems is up to the developer to decide - this level of description is mostly meant to improve readability, and the evaluator should not spend too much time on this aspect.

### Expected ADV_TDS content

IN order to meet ADV_TDS.3.2C and ADV_TDS.3.8C requirements, thedeveloper must provide the following tables:

_Modules:_

| Module | Type | SFR relevance | Upstream? | Env variables | config files | variables/flags | privileges | See details in section |
| ------ | ---- | ------------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
|        | ...  | ...           |           | ...           | ...          | ...             | ...        | ...                    |
| Note:  |      |               |           |               |              |                 |            |                        |

Notes:

* Classify modules as upstream or non upstream can be a difficult problem: CC does not require any mapping between "configuration items" and "subsystems" or "modules". In order to perform this mapping, the evaluator may in some cases have to:
  * manually map configuration items to the source code (e.g. using makefiles)
  * identify for all modules whether they are completely implemented by upstream source code, using the developer mapping from design to implementation (ADV_IMP.1)
* _type_ may be daemon, service, or process (which itself may include bash script, program, etc.)
* _SFR relevance_ means enforcing/supporting/non-interfering
* _privileges_ are typically mapped on the security domains described in ADV_ARC: Kernel/root/user and SUID/GID, possibly more (should the developer define more in ADV_ARC)

_Shared files:_

| Shared file | File permissions | Used with modules | See behaviour in section |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| ...         | ...              | ...               | ...                      |

_Signals:_

| Signals | Used with modules | See behaviour in section |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| ...     | ...               | ...                      |

_IPC and network sockets:

| channel | Type | Used w/ modules | Permissions of the channel | Protection in the channel | See details in section |
| ------- | ---- | --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ...     | ...  | ...             |                            | ...                       | ...                    |

Notes:

* This table will typically be used for:
  * sockets: USD, berkeley, network sockets...
  * anonymous / named pipes, network socket,
  * POSIX/System V message queues,
  * other such as dbus...
  * Shared memory,
  * other: process_vm_readv...
* _Permissions of the channel_ is usually the set of permissions of the file descriptor used to transmit data (e.g. in named pipes or sockets). It can also be the set of permissions of a message queue
* _Protection in the channel_ refers to additional protection, e.g. server-side credential or PID checking, use of encryption, etc.

## ADV_FSP

### CC refinements for a linux-based TOE

TSFIs happen at the limit of the TOE. As a general rule, they should be described as two different sets:

* physical interfaces : USB, KMS...
* network interfaces : ethernet, wireless

We will assume here that as in most SW evaluations, the physical interfaces are trusted, and that we will only care about the network interfaces. They need to be described at every (meaningful) layer - in most cases it will result in a table that loks like a network scan.

### Expected content for ADV_FSP

In order to meet ADV_FSP.4.1C and ADV_FSP.4.2C requirements, the developer must provide the following table: 

| TSFI        | port                              | Data link                                           | Internet                                                                                   | Transport | Applicative         | Corresp. module | Details in section |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| ...         | ...                               | ...                                                 | ...                                                                                        |           | ...                 | ...             | ...                |
| SSH         | 22                                | 802.03/eth                                          | IPv4/v6                                                                                    | TCP       | SSH v2              | sshd            | ...                |
| VPN         | 500 for IKE, 1500 for IPSec NAT-T | 802.03/eth                                          | IPSec/ESP in transport mode on IPv6 only (no IPv4), with the following cipher suites: etc. | UDP       | proprietary VPN app | Module X        | ...                |
| NTP         | 123                               | 802.03/eth                                          | IPv4/v6                                                                                    | UDP       | NTP v3              | ...             | ...                |

Note:
 - Additional information will be needed to meet other content requirements, such as parameters/actions/errors (ADV_FSP.4.3C/ADV_FSP.4.4C/ADV_FSP.4.5C). This information will typically only be provided at the highest (i.e. applicative) level 

## ADV_ARC

### CC refinements for a linux-based TOE

In order to meet ADV_ARC.1.2C, the developer must describe at least the following _Security domains:

* whether the TOE only uses linux default security domains (kernel/root/users and SUID/GID mechanisms) or whether it defines additional domains (capabilities, SELinux contexts, sandboxing, virtualization, etc.)
  * an explanation of which modules run in each security domain
  * a list of all users and groups, with their respective privileges (esp. access to sudo/su)
    * the password Policy for users, and how (by which means) it is enforced?
    * How are users identified/authenticated/authorized?
  * an explanation of how intermodule interactions within a domain are protected against other domains (e.g. named pipe is protected by permissions set to the current user, and ptrace is set to 3 to forbid other users to peek in the names pipe file)
  * an explanation of the authorized points of contact between domains
* A description of the filesystem of the TOE, and the associated permissions (incl. nosuid, nodev, noexec)
* A description of all drives, their intended use and how credentials are used, if any

In order to meet ADV_ARC.1.3C, the developer must describe at least the following _secure initialization_ measures:
* describe the initialization process (describe which bootloader is used, which initi process is used, whether the TOE customoizes the underlying linux boot process, etc.)
* describe whether some secure or measured boot is in place, and the HW support for these measures. 

In order to meet ADV_ARC.1.4C, the developer must describe at least the following _Self-protection:_ measures:
* Describe which firewalling features are in place on the TOE (e.g. iptables, ufw...) and explain their default configuration
* List the third-parties that are expected to be connected to the TOE through the network (e.g. SSO, PKI services such as OCSP, external NTP, back office for licensing, product updates, repositories to update 3rd party building blocks such as distro, libraries...). For all these third-parties, explain how the endpoints or payload are identified/authenticated, protected against tampering or eavesdropping, etc.:&#x20;

In order to meet ADV_ARC.1.5C, the developer must describe at least the following _non-bypassability_ measures:
* Hardening: Which hardening measures are used? (Yama ptrace scope, AppArmor, grsec, PaX, Execshield, SELinux, ASLR...)


# Additional information gathering

## Inventory scripts

Logged in as root on the TOE, run

* the [Low hanging fruits script](_resources/Low_hanging_fruits.sh): `sudo ./Low_hanging_fruits.sh > Low_hanging_fruits.md`
* the [Identification script](_resources/Identification.txt) (to be renamed in Identification.sh): `sudo ./Identification.sh > Identification.md`

## Inventory of network services

The network scan is often the first step in a CTF or black-box pentest. In a CC evaluation, it is way less crucial as a first step, since the interfaces of the TOE are supposedly already described in detail in ADV_FSP. This step is however crucial in order to check that the TOE _complies to its own documentation_.

### Listening services

**Network scan**

AVD_TDS should describe the Supported protocols at the applicative layer, which means that even before the network scan, the evaluator should know which ports are used, for which service, using which protocol(s). The network scan is normally only made to check potential discrepancies.

Starting from an anonymous access (no UDP research by default) `nmap -n -T4 -sV <IP>` coresponds to a very quick scan on most used ports: it should only be used on an easy challenge that is likely to expose low hanging fruits If there is a minimum level of coverage expected, use `nmap -n -T4 -p 1-65535 -sS <IP>`... then adapt

* if the TOE seems to have a reasonable attack surface, try a slow comprehensive scan, e.g. `nmap -sS -sU -A -v -PE -PP -PM -PS22,80,443 -PU40125 -PY -g 53 --script "default or (discovery and safe)" <IP>`
* if not, clarify with the developer why the surface is so large

NB: explanations almost as provided by [nmap own manual](https://nmap.org/book/man-briefoptions.html) 

* -n/-R: Never/Always do DNS resolution (here we don't resolve because we address the IP)
* -T<0-5>: Set timing template (higher is faster): here we try to do a "fast scan"
* -p 1-65535 : all possible ports
* -sS : TCP SYN
* -sU : UDP scan
* -A: Enable OS detection and version detection (not really needed) but also script scanning and traceroute
* -v is a verbose but not *too* verbose setting
* -PE/PP/PM: ICMP echo, timestamp, and netmask request discovery probes. The two latter are used only in case the TOE administrators would have specifically block echo request packets, while forgetting that other ICMP queries can be used for the same purpose.
* -PS22,80,443 sends an empty TCP packet with the SYN flag set on ports used for SSH/HTTP/HTTPS. change the ports of you known that the TOE uses other ones!
* -PU40125 corresponds to an UDP scan. 40125 is the default port used by nmap, and is used because it is unlikely to be active on the TOE (which is a desired property for this type of scan). If you known that the TOE uses this port, chose another one...
* -PY is a SCTP probe
* -g 53 means that nmap will send packets from port 53 (DNS). This is mostly meant as a basic evasion technique, in case the TOE would block traffic based on port - it is not really necessary in most evalaution contexts
* --script will launch some predefined scan scripts. The `safe` option is not chosen here for stealthiness bit rather to avoid crashes or hangs on the TOE, but the evaluator may chose `intrusive` instead if they feel lucky.

[TODO]: elaborate/improve on the choice of options... There are lots of suggestions on hacktricks, esp. for UDP

**Whitebox shortcut**

```
sudo netstat -tulpn 
```

NB: it may be useful to identify all connections (not only the ones listening) in case some network client on the TOE could open a vulnerable channel:

```
sudo netstat -tuapn 
```

### Searching for other possible connections from the TOE

The verification of listening services is not enough and many other conections may be created on-demand! confront what you can find on the TOE to the description in ADV For example 'apt' will create a client to connect to repos, and it will not appear in the listening services - What happens if

* the repo is accessed in http (which is frequent) **and** does not sign packages? (which should not happen)
* the repo is unofficial, untrusted and may well be considered compromised by default?

\[TODO]: How to search independently for such possible on-demand accesses?

* bad idea: listen on wireshark during the whole ATE tests. why is it a bad idea? even `apt` may be considered a non interfering feature and not tested/used during ATE
* search for http: ftp: in config files, e.g. `sudo find /etc/ -type f -exec grep -H 'http:' {} \;`?
* check nginx settings for https configs and /etc/xxx/ssl + /etc/xxx/xxx.conf.d for keys
* etc

### The special case of third-party services used by the TOE

Third party services used by the TOE are possible attack vectors, especially when they are trusted by design or even roots of trust. We will not detail the possible attack scenarios, though, because in the context of a CC evaluation, such third-parties are trusted by assumptions. What needs to be checked, though, is:

* the completeness of the ST and AGD docuöents:
  * does the product use a third-party SSO? PKI?
  * does the product rely on a back office for licensing, product updates? is the channel safe?
  * does the product rely on repositories to update 3rd party building blocks (distro, libraries...)? does it use non official repositories?
  * etc.
* the security of the connection to all these third-parties

## Preliminary test plan

The evaluator shall now be able to

* Draw an inventory of the TOE:
  * Potential low-hanging fruits (i.e. easily accessible vulnerabiities at the system level) -> See the output of the _Low hanging fruits_ script
  * Main features at the system level (users, filesystem, privileged processes, hardening measures...) -> See the output of the _Inventory_ script
  * Open ports and the corresponding network services -> see the output of the network inventory
* Check potential discrepancies between the inventory and ADV_TDS/FSP/ARC and ALC_LCD - notably check, for each component, whether it is:
  * a well known open source component (possibly patched by the developer)
  * anything other that that: open source but not well known, downright shady source, or simply proprietary developement
* List privileged processed and network services, and classify them as :
  * _TSF relevant_ : services (and traffic) pertaining to the trusted path to authenticated users, or protected communications with other IT Products. This can be plaintext (e.g. a simple HTTP session) or encrypted (e.g. TLS records). This obviously includes _underlying layers_ (e.g. the TCP/IP layer under the TLS session, ICMP, DNS...)
  * _non TSF relevant_ (e.g. an additional HTTP service not directly related to the user session) - check if these items run with significant privileges (for example, if a network service runs as root, or if it gives a full session to the user, e.g. ssh)
  * _no impact on TSF_: this will probably rarely exist in practice: these are the parts that would not have an impact on the TSF even if they were compromised/malicious (e.g. an antivirus contained in a VM, on a larger TSF)

Most importantly, **comment any discrepancy and clarify with the developer**.

The following table maps the resources the evaluator should take into account for each _non-upstream_ item identified (privileged process, privileged or unprivileged network service).

| Test/review the...                              | Protocol | Design | Config | Impl | CVEs |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| TSF relevant                                    | Yes      | Yes    | Yes    | Yes  | Yes  |
| Non-TSF process or network service (privileged) | No       | No     | Yes    | Yes  | Yes  |
| Non-TSF network service (non-privileged)        | No       | No     | Yes    | Yes  | Yes  |
| no impact on TSF                                | No       | No     | No     | No   | No   |

For the upstream components, no need for a table: protocols, design and code are _not_ reviewed. Only the configuration and public vulnerabilities are checked, and it can even be skipped if the componment has no impact on TSF.

NB:

* This table is constrained by the CC requirements themselves (TSF non interfering parts are less documented, even if they are running with privileges on the TOE). It would make sense to review the specs of protocols landing on privileged services on the TOE, regardless of their relationship to the TSF, because they cam lead to privilege escalation. However, specifications may not be available due to CC requirements themselves, and the evaluator (unfortunately) cannot bend the standard to their will.
